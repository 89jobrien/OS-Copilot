## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart

1. **Clone the GitHub Repository:** 

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/OS-Copilot/OS-Copilot.git
   ```

2. **Set Up Python Environment:** Ensure you have a version 3.10 or higher Python environment. You can create and
   activate this environment using the following commands, replacing `oscopilot_env` with your preferred environment
   name:

   ```
   conda create -n oscopilot_env python=3.10 -y
   conda activate oscopilot_env
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:** Move into the `OS-Copilot` directory and install the necessary dependencies by running:

   ```
   cd OS-Copilot
   pip install -e .
   ```

4. **Set OpenAI API Key:** Configure your OpenAI API key in [.env](.env) and select the model you wish to use.

5. **Running the Script:** Run the quick_start.py script, simply execute the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   python quick_start.py
   ```

\* FRIDAY currently only supports single-round conversation.

<!-- ## üõ†Ô∏è FRIDAY-Gizmos
We maintain an open-source library of toolkits for FRIDAY, which includes tools that can be directly utilized within FRIDAY.
For a detailed list of tools, please see [FRIDAY-Gizmos](https://github.com/OS-Copilot/FRIDAY-Gizmos). The usage methods are as follows:

1. Find the tool you want to use in [FRIDAY-Gizmos](https://github.com/OS-Copilot/FRIDAY-Gizmos) and download its tool code.
2. Add the tool to FRIDAY's toolkit:
```shell
python friday/tool_repository/manager/tool_manager.py --add --tool_name [tool_name] --tool_path [tool_path]
```
3. If you wish to remove a tool, you can run:
```shell
python friday/tool_repository/manager/tool_manager.py --delete --tool_name [tool_name]
```
