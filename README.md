## üìñ Overview

- **OS-Copilot** is a pioneering conceptual framework for building generalist computer agents on Linux and MacOS, which provides a unified interface for app interactions in the heterogeneous OS ecosystem.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart

1. **Clone the GitHub Repository:** 

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/OS-Copilot/FRIDAY.git
   ```

2. **Set Up Python Environment:** Ensure you have a version 3.10 or higher Python environment. You can create and
   activate this environment using the following commands, replacing `FRIDAY_env` with your preferred environment
   name:

   ```
   conda create -n FRIDAY_env python=3.10 -y
   conda activate FRIDAY_env
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:** Move into the `FRIDAY` directory and install the necessary dependencies by running:

   ```
   cd FRIDAY
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set OpenAI API Key:** Configure your OpenAI API key in `config.json` and select the model you wish to use.

5. **Execute Your Task:** Run the following command to start FRIDAY. Replace `[query]` with your task as needed. By default, the task is *"Move the text files containing the word 'agent' from the folder named 'document' to the path 'working_dir/agent'"*.  If the task requires using related files, you can use `--query_file_path [file_path]`.
   ```
   python run.py --query [query]
   ```
